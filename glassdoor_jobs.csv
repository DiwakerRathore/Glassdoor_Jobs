Data Scientist,-1,"This project requires a motivated data scientist to build and train python-based classification model prototypes that analyze raw data files and establish output data ranges across dimensions. These data models will deliver analytical results indicating type based on the inputted data. Models trigger and run on all new samples received in our cloud, accepting payloads and outputting staged-output scores. Outputs will be appended to existing record for review, analysis, and reporting.
Sample data is currently in an AWS cloud which is where your model will reside and be deployed. Upon completion, the deployed model will automatically ingest, process new data samples received through a web app and stored in an AWS DB, outputting classification results. Results will classify/stratify into groups of cohorts.
Overview of requirements:
Build, develop, and deliver core model in AWS infrastructure (EC2 (preferred), Sagemaker, Lambda, etc)
Configure necessary AWS infrastructure to support the model (EC2, Sagemaker)
Proactively investigate and explore data to uncover insights related to performance characteristics and traits, and communicate them clearly and compellingly to management
Required Experience:
Significant understanding and experience using/building/training/deploying machine learning, deep learning and A.I. algorithms and models
Extensive experience in model serving and workflow tools to enable rapid and reliable ML experimentation at scale.
Practical cloud computing experience with AWS technologies utilizing infrastructure as code methodologies to create high performance and data intensive platforms.
Programming skills in Python, R, SQL, Go, Bash programming with the ability to quickly create prototype and debug solutions on Cloud Native / Linux /embedded platforms.
MUST HAVE significant Python programming experience to be considered for this role. More information will be provided to the successful applicant.

Machine Learning Engineer,-1,"With supervised learning in Machine Learning (ML) having access to high-quality training datasets is essential to train ML algorithms effectively. Yet, the industry standard for producing these high-quality training datasets is to use human annotators who usually produce these datasets by hand. The main reason why this is the industry standard is that usually with an expert annotator who has the right domain knowledge the accuracy level for these training datasets is usually very high (99% or above) which is essential to train ML algorithms effectively. Otherwise, you could crowdsource the data to a crowdsourcing platform but then the accuracy level usually isn’t very high with this method. However, the two major downsides with these approaches are that the turnaround time for the datasets is usually very high. It could take weeks or months depending on the volume of the data. Moreover, because it’s done manually the cost is usually exorbitantly high.
In order to solve this huge data bottleneck that the ML pipeline faces we are building a program that will programmatically generate training datasets. The main challenge will be to keep the accuracy level at 99% or more but the turnaround time will come down significantly. We are talking about hours or even minutes over time and because it’s done programmatically the cost will be exorbitantly low.
This is a hard problem to solve, hence why there isn’t any go-to solution for this in the market yet. This is why I am looking for capable ML Engineers who will join our team to contribute towards solving this pressing issue that will help accelerate the growth of ML and AI applications in various industries and in consumer tech products throughout India.
Here are the specifications required for the job: You should have demonstrated interest and passion in ML/DL/AI in college through projects, internships, and/or research work. Work experience with ML and AI is also great. You should be well-versed in PyTorch and Python and other DL languages and applications. You should preferably be a hard-core ML/DL/AI person but even someone with knowledge of generative models, discriminative models, and other ML models is welcome to apply. You should be someone with the drive to complete a complicated task really well in 1/3 the time that most competent people deem possible and should have the drive to do important work that will put India on the map with ML and AI.
You will be working with some of the smartest people from IITs and other leading tech institutions to devise a solution to this hard problem.
If you want to be a part of this tectonic shift in AI, send in your application and I look forward to reviewing it.

I completed a 3-month internship at TEAL, primarily working on research and outreach activities for the company. During my time at TEAL, I was able to hone my writing skills under the guidance of TEAL's co-founder and CEO, Kshitij Batra. I was also given the opportunity to learn to work on different applications and test the company's flagship platform. The team members are friendly and extremely intelligent. In addition to this, everyone is very hardworking and ever-ready to do any sort of grunt work to meet the company goals, regardless of their position in the firm. Working in such a friendly and motivating environment was an amazing experience for me!
Delvin Chacko, Research Intern
My experience at TEAL surpassed all my expectations from the get-go. I was asked to help solve one of the most daunting problems in the Indian real estate market. Every day while working on a subset of the problem, the ideas that I brought to the table were shaped into cohesive solutions by a collaborative team effort. At TEAL I was exposed to the most cutting edge technologies such as Cloud Computing, Big Data, ML and Data Science. The growth opportunities at TEAL are tremendous, If you are innovative and can demonstrate the will to realize your ideas, TEAL is an amazing organization to work for.

Machine Learning Engineer,₹600K (Employer est.),"With supervised learning in Machine Learning (ML) having access to high-quality training datasets is essential to train ML algorithms effectively. Yet, the industry standard for producing these high-quality training datasets is to use human annotators who usually produce these datasets by hand. The main reason why this is the industry standard is that usually with an expert annotator who has the right domain knowledge the accuracy level for these training datasets is usually very high (99% or above) which is essential to train ML algorithms effectively. Otherwise, you could crowdsource the data to a crowdsourcing platform but then the accuracy level usually isn’t very high with this method. However, the two major downsides with these approaches are that the turnaround time for the datasets is usually very high. It could take weeks or months depending on the volume of the data. Moreover, because it’s done manually the cost is usually exorbitantly high.
In order to solve this huge data bottleneck that the ML pipeline faces we are building a program that will programmatically generate training datasets. The main challenge will be to keep the accuracy level at 99% or more but the turnaround time will come down significantly. We are talking about hours or even minutes over time and because it’s done programmatically the cost will be exorbitantly low.
This is a hard problem to solve, hence why there isn’t any go-to solution for this in the market yet. This is why I am looking for capable ML Engineers who will join our team to contribute towards solving this pressing issue that will help accelerate the growth of ML and AI applications in various industries and in consumer tech products throughout India.
Here are the specifications required for the job: You should have demonstrated interest and passion in ML/DL/AI in college through projects, internships, and/or research work. Work experience with ML and AI is also great. You should be well-versed in PyTorch and Python and other DL languages and applications. You should preferably be a hard-core ML/DL/AI person but even someone with knowledge of generative models, discriminative models, and other ML models is welcome to apply. You should be someone with the drive to complete a complicated task really well in 1/3 the time that most competent people deem possible and should have the drive to do important work that will put India on the map with ML and AI.
You will be working with some of the smartest people from IITs and other leading tech institutions to devise a solution to this hard problem.
